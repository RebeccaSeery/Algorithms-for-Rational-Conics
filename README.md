This is my final year project on Algorithms for Rational Conics. I really enjoyed this project so I'm putting it here in case anyone is interested.

The code uses Python and Sage. Sage is very awkward to run on Windows: you need to get a Windows Subsystem for Linux and then install it.
See here for the installation guide: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html

See the report for details on the mathematics behind the code.


sqrts.py - File containing the code for square roots mod n, as well as basic number theory algorithms such as the extended Euclidean algorithm and the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

rational_conics.py - Code to simplify conics and find rational points using the Hasse-Minkowski Theorem.

isomorphisms.py - Contains code for Hilbert symbols, detecting isomorphic conics, and getting the values of p for which a conic has no solutions over Q_p.
